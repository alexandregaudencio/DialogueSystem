# Unity-DialogueSystem
This repository is based on the project [https://github.com/alexandregaudencio/unity-dialogue-system](https://github.com/Wafflus/unity-dialogue-system). Therefore, please refer to the original repository to understand most of the features. Modifications have been made with the aim of serving as a dialogue flow without multiple choices, improving usability, optimizing the user experience, fixing bugs, and including new features. 

Soon, I will detail the modifications made and the purpose of these modifications.
